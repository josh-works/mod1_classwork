# Grains

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Build an implementation that can:

* calculate the number of grains on any specific square (ie: square number 6)
* calculate the number of grains on the entire board (ie: all 64 squares)
* calculate the number of grains across a range of spaces (ie: 6 through 12 inclusive)
